= Strangling the Spring Monolith with Quarkus

In this section of the lab, you will strangle the monolith with Quarkus. 

Currently the Pet Clinic application is developed as a monolith. All of the application functionality is in a single app. Here is a high-level architecture diagram of the application.

Let's refactor the application architecture to leverage microservices. The service related modules are replaced by microservices. Also, each microservice has a database that only contains information for its related entity. Based on this approach, we have three microservices as shown in the diagram below. Each microservice has its own database.

The `vets-service` manages the data for vets. The service exposes a method for retrieving a list of vets and their associated specialites.

The `visits-service` manages the data for pet visits. This service exposes methods to perform CRUD operations for pet visits.

The `customers-service` manages the data for owners and pets. It is a composition of the original modules for owners and pets. This service is a composition since there is a tight-relationship between owners and pets. This approach makes it easy to handle the database relationships.

In the essense of time, you will only develop one of the microservice in this lab. You will develop the `vets-service`. We will provide the remaining microservices for you (`visits-service` and `customers-service`).

You will also update the petclinic web application to leverage the new `vets-service`.

== vets-service

In this section, you will develop the `vets-service`. 

The vets-service exposes the following endpoint:
[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description
| GET | /vets | Retrieves a list of vets and their associated specialties
|===

The vets-service has the following architecture:

You will first develop the service and then refactor the web application to use the service.

=== Review code for vets-service
To help with development, there is a basic starter project for the vets-service.

. Open the project for `vets-service`

. Review the starter code for vets service View the following packages
.. Model: `org.acme.model`
.. Service: `org.acme.service`
.. Resource: `org.acme.rest`

. View the application configuration files in the directory: `src/main/resources`
.. `application.properties`
.. `import.sql`
+
====
NOTE: The `import.sql` file loads SQL statements when Hibernate ORM starts. This script can contain any SQL DML statements. Make sure to terminate each statement with a semicolon. This is useful to have a data set ready for your tests or demos.

== Add Resource method to Retrieve Vets

Now let's add the resource method to retrieve the vets from the database. Developing REST APIs with Quarkus is similar to using Spring Boot. Quarkus uses JAX-RS from the Microprofile spec. 

Here's a list of common annotations used for REST development.

[options="header"]
|===
| Spring Annotation | JAX-RS Annotation
| @RequestMapping | @Path
| @GetMapping | @GET 
| @PostMapping | @POST 
| @PutMapping | @PUT 
| @DeleteMapping | @DELETE
| @PathVariable | @PathParam
| @RequestParam | @QueryParam
|===


. Open the file: VetsResource.java
** Make note of the base path for the resource. The resource endpoint is :`/vets` 
+
----
@Path("/vets")
---- 

** Make note of the @Produces annotation. The endpoints for this resource will produce JSON content.
+
----
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
----

. Add the following code to inject the VetsService
+
----
    @Inject
    VetsService service;
---- 

. Add the method to retrieve the vets
----
    @GET
    public List<Vet> get() {
        LOG.debug("Inside get() method");
        return service.getAll();
    }
----
